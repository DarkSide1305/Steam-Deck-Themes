# Steam Deck Themes

This repository contains various themes that I created for use with [suchmememanyskill's Steam Deck CSS loader](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader).

## Installation

1. Install the [Steam Deck plugin loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader). The pre-release is recommended at the time of this guide being written.
1. Open the Plugins section in the Quick Access menu.
1. Open the [Plugin Store](https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/) using the shopping bag icon in the top-right corner.
1. Install [suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader).
1. Hold the power button and select Switch to Desktop.
1. Navigate to `/home/deck/homebrew/themes`.
1. Copy the folder(s) from this repository (ex. Obsidian) into the themes folder.
1. Select Return to Gaming Mode on the desktop.
1. Open the CSS Loader plugin and enable your desired theme(s).

## Themes

Below are previews and brief descriptions for each theme.

### Obsidian

This theme is based off of pure black themes commonly created for AMOLED devices. Although the Steam Deck has an LCD screen, I find the darker colors easier on my eyes
and less Steam-themed.

### Round

This theme adds round edges to any image that can reasonably have them. Certain images like achievements, trading cards, and profile pictures have been left as-is to
avoid removing any detail. Anything largely rectangular or difficult to round (ex. sets of buttons, chat, header) has also been left as-is.

If you want to contribute to my themes, please create an issue first and only do so to fix missing style changes. Make sure to specify in your pull request what I
missed and include screenshots of how you fixed it. I greatly appreciate any help in refining my themes.
